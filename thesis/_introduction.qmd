# Introduction

Blender is a free, open-source 3D creation suite used for modeling, animation, visual effects, simulation, and rendering. It is powerful enough for studios and still accessible to students and independent artists who are building skills and portfolios on limited budgets. The tradeoff is a steep learning curve. New users juggle Object Mode versus Edit Mode, a long list of operators (the actions that do things in Blender), a stack of modifiers like Bevel or Subdivision Surface, and a dense interface split across the 3D Viewport, the Outliner, and the Properties editor. In practice, even simple tasks such as beveling edges without ruining shading or setting up a three-point light often turn into long searches through videos and forum threads that are close to the answer but not quite for the exact situation at hand.

This project introduces **Suzanne**, an N-panel add-on that brings an in-viewport learning assistant directly into Blender. Suzanne returns short, numbered, step-by-step instructions that map to the exact operators and panels a user can see, so the workflow becomes: read a step, do the step, move on to the next step. It can also transcribe an audio file such as a quick voice note and turn it into a concise recipe in the panel. The goal is not to replace full courses or deep study. The goal is to reduce the time spent searching while a user is actively creating and to help artists finish more projects that they can render, publish, and add to a portfolio.

**Problem statement.** Blender creators, especially beginners and self-taught artists, lose time and momentum because guidance typically lives outside the application and is rarely written as exact, reproducible steps for the user’s current context. Suzanne keeps instruction inside the viewport and expresses it as minimal, verifiable steps that align to Blender’s interface. This reduces context switching and improves follow through.

### A minimal Blender primer to ground the steps

- **Where things are.** The 3D Viewport is the work area. The Outliner lists scene objects. The Properties editor contains contextual tabs for Object, Modifiers, Materials, Render, and more. The N-panel on the right hosts add-ons. This is where Suzanne lives.
- **Modes matter.** Many tools are mode specific. Clear instructions should state Object Mode or Edit Mode up front.
- **Operators and search.** Every action is an operator. You can trigger it from a menu or press **F3** and type the operator name. Using operator names in steps makes them easy to reproduce.
- **Transforms and selection.** G, R, and S handle move, rotate, and scale. Add X, Y, or Z to constrain an axis. A selects all. Alt A clears selection. B and C trigger box and circle select. Steps should cite these when relevant.
- **Modifiers and order.** The modifier stack is non destructive, but order changes results. For example, applying Bevel before Subdivision Surface can preserve crisp edges.
- **Shading and normals.** Common fixes include Shade Smooth, Auto Smooth, and Recalculate Normals.

### How individuals actually use Blender and why that matters for portfolios

Students and independent creators build portfolios piece by piece. A clean hard surface prop, a short animation, a stylized character, a product visualization, or a shader study can all become strong entries. Each piece requires many small and correct steps in sequence. The main blocker is not always a lack of big picture knowledge. The blocker is micro level execution. Which tab holds Auto Smooth. Why a bevel collapsed. How to light a small scene quickly with area lights so the forms read.

Suzanne targets these micro blocks. Because it lives in the N-panel, a creator can stay in flow.

- **Fix faceted shading on a beveled object**
  1. Object Mode, right click, **Shade Smooth**
  2. Properties, Object Data (green triangle), Normals, enable **Auto Smooth**
  3. If the object still looks faceted, switch to Edit Mode, press **A**, then Mesh, Normals, **Recalculate Outside**

- **Add Subdivision Surface without changing the silhouette**
  1. Object Mode, Modifiers (wrench), **Add Modifier**, **Bevel**
  2. Set Limit Method to Angle, set Segments to 2, and adjust Amount until edges read correctly
  3. Add **Subdivision Surface** below Bevel so the order is Bevel then Subdivision
  4. Set Viewport Level to 2 and Render Level to 3 or 4 based on performance

These short recipes produce portfolio quality improvements. They stabilize geometry, improve surface quality, and make renders read better. Repeated across weeks, they lead to cleaner topology, faster lighting setups, and more confident scene assembly. Those qualities are visible in wireframes, clay renders, turntables, and final beauty passes. They are also what faculty reviewers and hiring managers look for. Because steps reference operators and panels explicitly, they are easy to document in a case study. A student can capture screenshots, annotate each step, and include the process alongside final images.

Blender’s open ecosystem also means users run different versions and hardware. Suzanne focuses on clear prerequisites such as mode and selection and includes light troubleshooting branches such as “If faceted, turn on Auto Smooth.” This lowers frustration across setups and helps more artists keep shipping new work, which is the most important factor in portfolio growth.

## Motivation

The motivation for Suzanne is practical and student centered. The goal is to keep guidance where the work happens and express it in the smallest useful unit, which is a verified step. That way individuals can create more and better art with the time they have.

- **Reduce context switching.** Leaving Blender to parse long videos and scattered forum posts breaks concentration and wastes time. By staying in the viewport, a creator can read a step and immediately perform it while keeping the camera, selection, and mental state intact.
- **Accelerate first wins.** Early success builds confidence. A beginner who can bevel cleanly, fix shading, set up a basic three point light, and render a turntable in the first sessions is more likely to continue and to post work. Suzanne aims to make those early wins repeatable.
- **Support self directed learning.** Many portfolio builders learn in short sessions. Clear and numbered steps reduce the overhead of getting back into a scene after a break and make progress visible every time they open Blender.
- **Improve reproducibility for case studies.** Portfolios that include process stand out. Before and after renders, topology views, and modifier settings are stronger when they are tied to named operators and exact paths. Suzanne’s steps double as documentation that is easy to paste into a README, a blog post, or slides.
- **Enable different learning styles.** Some creators prefer to speak their intent or struggle with precise English terminology. File based audio transcription lets them describe the issue naturally and still receive precise, structured steps.
- **Prepare for evaluation and growth.** Since the instructions are structured, it is straightforward to measure time on task and accuracy in a small study. Those measurements unlock future improvements such as next and back buttons, live microphone capture, or tool calling for safe operator execution.

In short, Suzanne is motivated by the needs of individual creators who are learning Blender while they build a body of work. By turning scattered knowledge into in app, actionable recipes, Suzanne helps artists finish more projects, present them cleanly, and grow portfolios with consistent and higher quality pieces.

## Ethical Implications 

This document requires that you discuss the ethical implications of your work -- no
matter how benign you consider the outcome of your project. As several major studies
of ethical issues in computer science assert: _no project is completely value-neutral_.

To assist you in elaborating on these issues, the following areas are topics you might
consider addressing. You do not need to address all of them.

* Information Privacy
* Information Accuracy (e.g. can contain reliability)
* Potential Misuse (e.g. computer crime, unintended consequences)
* Second- or Third-Party Risk (e.g. safety)
* Data Collection Issues (e.g. issues inherent in collecting data)
* Algorithmic or Data Bias
* Potential Power Difference / Social Imbalance / Issues in Equity

In addition, reflect on ways that the above harms can be or are mitigated by your work.
